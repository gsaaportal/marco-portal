The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) further defines marine protected areas within its jurisdiction as a network of specific areas of marine environments reserved and managed for the primary purpose of aiding in the recovery of overfished stocks and to insure the persistence of healthy fish stocks, fisheries, and habitats. Such areas may be over natural or artificial bottom and may include prohibition of harvest on a permanent or lesser time period to accomplish needed conservation goals. The SAFMC proposes nine management actions to amend the current Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The primary purpose of these actions is to employ a collaborative approach to identify Marine Protected Area (MPA) sites with the potential to protect a portion of the population and habitat of slow growing, long-lived deepwater snapper grouper species (speckled hind, snowy grouper, Warsaw grouper, yellowedge grouper, misty grouper, golden tilefish, and blueline tilefish) from directed fishing pressure to achieve a more natural sex ratio, age, and size structure within the proposed MPAs, while minimizing adverse social and economic impacts. Eight of the actions would establish Type 2 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs); one off southern North Carolina, three off South Carolina, one off Georgia, and three off Florida. The MPAs are intended NEED to REVISE: to be used in concert with traditional management measures to enhance the optimum size, age, and genetic structure of slow growing, long-lived deepwater snapper grouper species. For the purposes of Amendment 14, the Council is proposing ""Type 2"" MPAs where no person may fish for a South Atlantic snapper grouper in an MPA and no person may possess a South Atlantic snapper grouper in an MPA. However, the prohibition on possession does not apply to a person aboard a vessel that is in transit with fishing gear appropriately stowed. The ninth action would prohibit use of shark bottom longlines in the Type 2 MPAs to protect deepwater species and their habitat.

The Council submitted CE-BA 1 and associated final environmental impact statement for review, approval, and implementation by NOAA Fisheries Service. The final rule to establish the deepwater coral HAPC was published in the Federal Register on June 22, 2010 (75 FR 35330) and the provisions are effective July 22, 2010. CE-BA 1 amends the Coral, Coral Reefs, Live/Hard Bottom Habitats of the South Atlantic Region Fishery Management Plan (Coral FMP) to establish Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (CHAPCs) to protect what is believed to be the largest distribution (>60,000 square kilometers; 23,000 square miles) of deepwater coral ecosystems in the world. In the South Atlantic region, deepwater coral ecosystems are coral, coral reefs, and live/hardbottom habitat in waters extending from 400 meters (1,300 feet) to the seaward boundary of the exclusive economic zone. Within the CHAPCs, the possession of coral species and the use of all bottom damaging gear is prohibited including bottom longline, trawl (bottom and mid-water), dredge, pot or trap, or the use of an anchor, anchor and chain, or grapple and chain by all fishing vessels."

The Great Lakes population is federally listed as endangered, while the Atlantic and Northern Great Plains populations are listed as threatened. Piping plovers are considered threatened on their wintering grounds.  Due to the difficulty of separating out the populations of piping plover (Great Lakes, Northern Great Plains, and Atlantic) when on their wintering grounds, critical habitat was designated for all wintering piping plover.

Coastal Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (AMBUR-HVA),Coastal Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (AMBUR-HVA),,,,Habitat,Coastal and Marine Models,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The GovernorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ South Atlantic Alliance supported the development of a new
coastal hazard vulnerability assessment tool as one of their regional
initiatives. A project team of scientists and managers from GA (C. Alexander,
Skidaway Institute of Oceanography; C. Jackson, Georgia Southern Univ.; J.
Kline, GA Dept. Natural Resources), NC (JP Walsh and R. Corbett, East Carolina
Univ.; K. Richardson, NC Dept. Environment and Natural Resources), SC (S.
Howard, SC Geological Survey; J. Boynton, SC Dept. of Health and Environmental
Control) and FL (J. Jaeger, Univ. Florida; J. Dennis, FL Dept. Economic
Opportunity) collaborated to design a simple, defensible and robust tool that
would meet managersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ needs. C. Jackson implemented the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision for the
tool by building new features and capabilities into an existing tool for
analyzing shoreline change (Analysis of Moving Boundaries Using Ã¢â‚¬ËœRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shoreline
Change Analysis (AMBUR-SCA); Jackson et al., 2012). The new tool (Analysis of
Moving Boundaries Using Ã¢â‚¬ËœRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (AMBUR-HVA))
evaluates and ranks individual and composite vulnerabilities to shoreline change
over both spatial and temporal dimensions (determined using AMBUR-SCA),
inundation from storm and riverine flooding (using SLOSH and FEMA data), and
social vulnerability in recovery from disasters (Social Vulnerability Index, S.
Cutter, Univ. South Carolina). By using datasets that are widely available or
easily created, this new tool provides a means of conducting consistent,
regional assessments of coastal hazard vulnerability. Funding for the Alliance
and this effort was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
